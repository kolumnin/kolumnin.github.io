[Continuous Integration status](https://github.com/kolumnin.github.io/www.githubstatus.com/workflows/Continuous%20Integration)

This web site 
[kolumnin.github.io](http://kolumnin.github.io) is
hosted by [GitHub](https://GitHub.com) [pages](https://pages.github.com/) and styled by [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com) style schemes.

This is an example website generated by a nonprogramer end user, by just following the GitHub instructions to the level of my understanding. I don't do any machine coding myself, though familiar with a few computer display languages.
The display is the intellectual and logistic automation scripts by the GitHub coding experts.

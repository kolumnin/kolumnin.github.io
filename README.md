This web site 
[KOLUMNIN](https://kolumnin.github.io) is
hosted by [GitHub](https://GitHub.com) [pages](https://pages.github.com/) and styled by [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com) style schemes.

This is an example website generated by a nonprogramer end user, by just following the GitHub instructions to the level of my understanding and memory. I don't do any machine coding myself, though familiar with a few computer display languages.
The display is the intellectual and logistic automation scripts by the GitHub coding experts.

The world wide web must be safe for the beginners, intelligent learners skillful experts, and also for slow-paced and having  only the basic curiosity to know about the technological advancements.  In my web sites, most of my activities in the internet are stacked together to form a quick learning domain
for myself and for all others associated with my actions.

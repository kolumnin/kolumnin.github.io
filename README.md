This web site 
[kolumnin.github.io](http://kolumnin.github.io) is
hosted by [GitHub](https://GitHub.com) [pages](https://pages.github.com/) and styled by [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com) style schemes.

This website is used to share my experiences with GitHub programs as an uninitiated end user. I hardly do any coding myself, though familiar with a a few computer languages.
The sharing of my human and biological responses weighs over the intellectual and logistic evaluation of the methods and scripts suggested in the GitHub.

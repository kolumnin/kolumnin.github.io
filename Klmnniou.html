<div>Knowledge is the essence of a happy life on the Earth, fulfilling all human desires. Knowledge sharing has been an important aspect in human social evolution. The Humanity shares all geographical resources distributed over nations. We do share our inventions and technology for profits as nations, societies, companies, groups and individuals. But sharing technology or instruments do not always result in sharing knowledge. There is lot is secrecy associated with knowledge and every individual is very possessive about certain knowledge, experience or belief. The knowledge of a new material is kept secret till it is published in a cooperative society commited to ensuring profits to the discoverer or inventor. Knowledge in higher levels of existence on the Earth are either religious, esoteric and obtainable only by digilant practices and often hardships. So knowledge sharing wherever possible is very important in our short human lifetime. The systematic knowledge can be acquired by "modern education" where lessons are repeated and practiced till certain techniques are impressed and rememberable on demand. Modern electronic devices are infact the best "students" of modern technology. All our inventions are artificial, art-skills materialized, and technology of natural knowledge transfers are underdeveloped. With ever increasing numbers to deal with, the living biological worlds on the Earth is left to chance and distant galacteical destinies, in the area of discriminated knowledge sharing during their lifetimes.

<P>Without enough restraints, my goals can not be positive, as my first steps on this screen fields are always random.
With the patterns generated, by actions give me a sense of joy, without entering into the thinking fields of the programers or the machine.
Thus all my "contributions" are just trying to utter a sound to express thanks for my experiences, looking into and touching this mobile screen!
</P>

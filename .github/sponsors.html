I am Dr. Muraleedharan Koluthappallil or simply Muraleedharan from India.

I have a background in Physics, and a Ph.D. degree(1986) in condensed matter physics. But I am unable to contribute any more in the professional field due to many issues, and I am not ashamed to be a slow learner. I have not been able to succeed in any profitable business so far, no job since 1995 and receive no pension.

I am working at the internet through the GitHub as an aged person, with out any formal training, 60+, and my memory is weak. Nevertheless the GitHub gives me opportunities to learn to organize in a global framework of logistics, to help create a stable, protective environment in the electronic network field, ofcourse, within limitations of my skills in learning.

I can not compete and I am vulnerable to exploitations and violations of many kinds, especially in the fast electronics linked economy. I have no idea how my neighbours prosper in living standards, how they conduct profitable business linked to my daily activities, and they keep it top secret.

I need financial support in a manageable way and without adding stress and strain to my mind and body which suffers frequent migraine attacks.
Ageing weakens actions but the aged have experience, power to sense and judge, and direct issues in human life, which might be missed in youthful days.

This will remain my global view as a human biological being, when I am no more contributing anything more in these projects helping to evolve better human social reorganization concepts.
I plan to use my fund for my daily sustenance of the telecom, internet and electronic connectivity and my physical being. Financial terms are strong gateways to prevent remote abuse of various domains of internet activity. I presently do not have sufficient resources and fund to make use of the available internet optimization, within my limited skills. Hence your  financial support will be very useful to me for the rest of my life on the Earth.

How our developing technology accelerates ageing and biological weakness is a riddle. The social impact of an electronic program can be estimated reasonably by statistics. But the impacts on an individual, in the human context, is not an easy task, let alone give any useful response or directions to the programer for a modification of the global trend and ultimate goal. Our attention is focused only when something fails or our logic is overpowered by our own constructions. The individuals are the best monitors of the economic, biological emotional and intellectual outcome of the fast programed constructions. The only problem is as we grow older, our responses slow down, interests weaken and focus becomes distributed or unknown. We are not lifeless machines, and what we are able to transfer to the coming generations are not yet, our experienced judgements, but machine optimised commands. Hence the ultimate goal must be to tune the man made electronic programs almost God-like, protecting us from every direction, independent of our individual child-like play in the current huge modern electromagnetic environment.

Here are some ideas of what you can tell your potential sponsors:
- [ ] Who are you, and where are you from?
- [ ] What are you working on?
- [ ] Why is their sponsorship important? How will you use the funds?

Hint: You can include images and emojis in your bio!
When I am using my mobile phone or any electronic gadget, together me and the device form a "company",  which needs to obey certain global written and yet to be written rules and terms. 
When the device is connected to a telecom service provider, e.g.  BSNL, me, the device and BSNL form a new temporary, dynamic company, which too must obey accepted global terms and conditions. 
When a software application is used for any activity in the internet, the software provider adds to the terms and conditions, together with the company grown up to cover the entire Earth, and exists as a temporary recognisable electromagnetic entity which can be labelled with the attributes of an individual, company or organisation to take care of the responsibility of any action performed. 
"KOLUMNIN" is defined in that sense, as such, an "organisation", a "company" and "individual". The existing tax and regulations rules for companies in general must be adapted automatically during  existence of the "Individual-Internet-Company". I do not have a clear understanding of the level of global programing  in this direction. The existing programed impersonation levels must be free from generating any biological harm to such individual entity both on and offline.
I had tried to form a "My Business" under Google application but failed to bring any financial gain due to illegal duplications. I can do nothing to prevent somebody trying to make a duplicate account at a remote terminal, while I am struggling to fill up a form on my mobile screen with my poor sight and memory. What if they continue copying my mobile contents during night, denying me a rightful rest? My Google sites of periodic articles, are blocked from editing and posting. Success is defined for those internet entities under  the protection of a Domain name,  Advertisements, Tax laws, Company Rules, Annual income slabs, Salary accounts, Number of employees etc etc, which are beyond the capabilitis and interest of people like me to build and maintain. Nor am I  in an age group or technically qualified enough to be "employed" in  a software company. 
With continuing interest to work at the internet global community, sensing the effects of global activities on my biological being, but not getting any returns for the daily work, is very depressing. Worse are the exploitation by the neighborhood peers taking away all the results and generate daily income, with mere piping, impersonation and making use of copied passwords, synchronised with human neuro-biological exploitation. With no sense of a "company" or rules is a sad state of affairs in the field of the development of the digital  electronics field security and economy in India. The "crimes" associated with these activities, accumulated over years, are being covered by religious hoods, loudspeakers, head-tuned electrical gadgets and pose severe threats to life and health. These situations can not be wiped off by sweepstakes lottories or huge compensation allurements or lengthy tiring court procedures, from abroad or black-money networks. I appeal to my sponsors to help me build an existential support and daily income, with my existing inadequate skills and learning in the field of company or business management.12:26 02Aug22from "Autobiography of Dr.K.Muraleedharan".
As mentioned in the beginning, I am not involved in any deep technical professional activities, or any sustained vision, knowledge or understanding of the world of computer languages or codes. But I wish to continue examining and sharing my observations on the effects of various electronic network environments as inputs into  myself as a living human and also my personal judgements on situations based on my life experiences.
I will be using the financial support for maintenance of the mobile device, SIM recharges, internet connectivity and occasional browsing at internet cafe terminals. Whatever remaining would be used for my bio-support.
currently existing economic slabs and wide gaps in daily income at the individual level, makes the global realisation of tax rules somewhat distant.13:05
